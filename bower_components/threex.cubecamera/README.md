threex.cubecamera
=============

threex.cubecamera is a three.js extension which provide an helper for cube cameras.
It is very usefull when a given object must reflect a texture cube live.
Be carefull, this require 6 rendering of the scene everytime you update it.
It becomes expensive fast.

TODO to port in its own demo. use the "minecraft goes party" from nextgamefrontier talk

How To Install It
=================

You can install it via script tag

```html
<script src='threex.cubecamera.js'></script>
```

Or you can install with [bower](http://bower.io/), as you wish.

```bash
bower install threex.cubecamera
```


How To Use It
=============

First you need to create a classic mesh, the one which gonna reflect the live texture cube.
In this example, we gonna create sphere with the color 'gold' like this.

```
var geometry	= new THREE.SphereGeometry(0.5, 32, 16)
var material	= new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({
	color	: 'gold'
})
var mesh	= new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)
scene.add( mesh )	
```

Now we needs to create the cube camera which gonna update the texture cube live.
We do that like this.

```
var cubeCamera	= new THREEx.CubeCamera(mesh)
scene.add(cubeCamera.object3d)
```

Don't forget to update it when needed (likely at every frame)

```
cubeCamera.update(renderer, scene)
```

Now that we got the textureCube, we set the mesh material to reflect this texture cube.

```
material.envMap	= cubeCamera.textureCube
```

This is it! Now you got the live texture cube on your sphere :)
