# image from eric

* A single one of these orbs, floating in space 
* A glossy, reflective outer shell that has a of a feeling of thickness.
* A radiant, inner core that has a subtle color hue and a luminous property


## how to get that ?

### Step 1
* metallic ball
* geometric glow
* reflection map. live or not. propose

### Step 1.5
* how to do the hollow things... not sure
* maybe a actually transparent ball with something inside ?
  * 

### Step 2
* bloom post processing
* see about glitch.html in incubator

### Step 3
* metabally internal sphere
  * just a sphere with updatable geometry with perlin ?
